This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Testing

Unit tests run on [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) + [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) (jsdom):

```bash
npm test           # run the suite once
npm run test:watch # watch mode
npm run test:coverage # suite + coverage floors (global + lib/**)
```

Conventions (see `plans/unit-tests/` for the full plan and decisions):

- **Co-located tests** — `foo.test.ts(x)` sits next to `foo.ts(x)`; no separate `tests/` tree.
- **Unit target = `lib/` module or client component**, never an `app/**/page.tsx` Server
  Component (those pull `cookies()`/Supabase and belong to a future Playwright e2e plan,
  as does `lib/supabase/*`).
- **Mock only the `next/*` boundary** (`next/image`, `next/navigation`, `next/headers`) —
  the component/module under test always runs for real.
- CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs lint + the coverage-gated suite on every PR and
  push to `main`. Coverage floors in `vitest.config.ts` only ratchet up — add the missing
  test instead of lowering a floor.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
